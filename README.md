## About Pet Store eCommerce.

This is a website dedicated to selling products and services for pets.

This responsive website is divided into three main elements:
- Navigation Bar
- Main Window
- Footer

Refer to the description of each element below:

### Navigation Bar.
This section of the website contains the following elements
- Store logo. This element works as a "Home" button. The user will be redirected to the landing page if the user clicks on this element.
  - **This element should be persistent in all the screen breakpoints.**
- Main shortcuts. These are some of the main actions that a user has access to. When displayed in a Tablet breakpoint, these options should be reorganized so all of them can be properly displayed. When displayed in a Phone breakpoint, these options should be reorganized in a "hamburger menu" so there is enough room on the screen to display all the elements.
  - **This element should be responsive according to the device that is being used.**
- Shopping Cart. This element works as a link to the user's shopping cart, in other words, this displays the current user's order. When there is at least one element in the cart, the image should be updated to display the number of items in the cart.
  - **This element should be persistent in all the screen breakpoints.**

### Main Window.
 - This is the main screen. This is a dynamic screen that changes based on the user's actions. When this screen works as a home page, it will display a predefined background picture with a main "Shop Now" button. Once the user scrolls down, the following two sections will be displayed: "Featured Items", and "Deals by pet". When displayed in a Tablet/Phone breakpoint, these options should be reorganized so all of them can be properly displayed.
   - **This element should be responsive according to the device that is being used.**
